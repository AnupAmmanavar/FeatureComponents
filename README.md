# FeatureComponents
Creating loosely-coupled Reactive Feature Components


## Overview
* Re-usability is a pattern that solves the problem of duplication. It can be as simple as creating Functions, Classes, Interfaces to more complex **UI-Components** and **Feature-Components**.

* The article focuses initially on the re-usability of UI-Views(**UIComponents**) and then the **FeatureComponents**. 
* Emphasis is on the [Dependency-Inversion Principle](https://www.oodesign.com/dependency-inversion-principle.html), where both the Low-level(Feature Component) and High-level component (One incorporating the low-level components) both depend on abstraction, to create loosely-coupled systems.



## A peek into UI Component [UI-level]

Before proceeding to Feature Components, weâ€™ll start with a brief overview of UI-Components(re-usability of Views).

* Data is sent downwards from **HLC â†’ LLC**, while the Events are sent from the **LLC â†’ HLC**.

**Low-Level Component (UIComponent)**: 
It only renders itself based on the data provided by the High-level component. And propagates the events to the High-level component(ðŸ‘‡). Itâ€™s devoid of business-logic.

```kotlin
class UIComponent(
  private val data: ComponentData,
  private val eventDispatch: UIComponentEventDispatch) {
  
  // Renders based on the data provided by HLC
  fun render(view: UIComponentView) {
    view.data = data
    view.invalidate()
  }
  
  fun onRandomEvent(payLoad: Data) {
    // Sends the event to the HLC
    eventDispatch.handleEvent1(payLoad)
  }
}

interface UIComponentEventDispatch {
  fun handleEvent1(payLoad: Data)
}
```
**High-level Component**: Provides the data for the UI-Components(LLC), and handles the events from the UIComponent(ðŸ‘‡). Example: Click events. It holds all the business logic. It is a single source of truth that holds the state/data for all the UI-Component.

```kotlin
class HighLevelComponent {
  // Provides the data for UI component and passes the handler for handling events from UIComponent dispatch
  val uiComponent = UIComponent(data, UIComponentEventHandler())
  
  // Handles the events from the UIComponent.
  inner class UIComponentEventHandler: UIComponentEventDispatch {
    fun handleEvent1(payLoad: Data) { ... }
  }
  
  fun renderPage() {
    uiComponent.render(uiComponentView)
  }
}

```

## Reactive Feature Component

UIComponents are useful when there is re-usability of UI-views, while Feature Component has larger functionality.

* Apart from receiving the data, it also produces the data itself.
* Contains its own business-logic.
* Needs lesser hand-holding than UIComponent and is useful for designing SDKs and standalone features

Why **Reactive** Feature Component?:- With multiple Components producing data, we need a way to synchronize them. Ex: Data produced by FC1 might affect FC2.

We will take a bottom-up approach, where we Design and Implement the Low-level Feature components first, and later look their incorporation into the High-level Component.


## Step 1 : Design of Low-level Feature Components(LLC)

For demonstration purposes, we build a Flight Booking screen. It includes the following four Low-level Feature Components **DateSelection**, **FlightsSelection**, **HotelSelection**, and **SummaryComponent**.

The design of the FeatureComponent looks like this(ðŸ‘‡)

Letâ€™s look at the Flight Feature Component

### 1. EventDispatcher
Dispatches the events to High-level-Component. This is like a channel through which events are sent to the outside world(HLC).

```kotlin
interface EventDispatcher

/**
 * Dispatches the events from the FlightFeatureComponent. This is like a channel through which we sent events to the outside world
 * There are two types of event
 * 1. Change in FeatureState needs to be propagated
 * 2. Other events like Clicks that are controlled by the parent and not handled by the current FeatureComponent
 */
interface FlightEventDispatcher : EventDispatcher {
    fun onFlightSelection(flight: Flight)
}
```

* `onFlightSelection` a flight selection event is sent to the outside world. This may then be used by another FeatureComponent.

### 2. EventReceiver
Feature Component receives the events from the High-level component.

```kotlin
interface EventReceiver

interface FlightEventReceiver : EventReceiver {
    // Change in date will let the FlightComponent to update itself.
    // Makes an API call to fetch the flights for the specified date
    fun dateChange(date: Date)

    fun onRemoveSelection()
}
```
This is a gateway through which it receives events from the HLC.
* `dateChangeA` - change in date from another component is received. On reception, it fetches the flights for the said date.
* `onRemoveSelection` - clears the selected flight.

### 3. UI
Every Feature Component has its own UI.

```kotlin
interface UI<V : ViewGroup> {
    fun render(view: V)
}

interface FeatureComponent<V:ViewGroup>:  UI<V>
```

* Every FeatureComponent extends the UI interface, implying that they define their own UI.
* HLC attaches it. `render` is a public API for the HLC to render the FeatureComponent by passing the view(More detail later in Implementation ðŸ‘‡).
